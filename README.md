# envstruct

envstruct is a simple library for populating values on structs from environment
variables.

## Documentation

[https://godoc.org/github.com/bradylove/envstruct](https://godoc.org/github.com/bradylove/envstruct)

## Usage

Export some environment variables.

```
$ export HOST_IP="127.0.0.1"
$ export HOST_PORT="443"
```

Write some code. In this example, `Ip` requires that the `HOST_IP` environment variable is set to non empty value and
`Port` defaults to `80` if `HOST_PORT` is an empty value. Then we use the `envstruct.WriteReport()` to print a
table with a report of what fields are on the struct, the type, the environment variable where the value is read from,
whether or not it is required, and the value.

```
package main

import "github.com/bradylove/envstruct"

type HostInfo struct {
	Ip   string `env:"host_ip,required"`
	Port int    `env:"host_port"`
}

func main() {
	hi := HostInfo{Port: 80}

	err := envstruct.Load(&hi)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	envstruct.WriteReport(&hi)
}
```

Run your code and rejoice!

```
$ go run example/example.go
FIELD NAME:  TYPE:   ENV:       REQUIRED:  VALUE:
Ip           string  HOST_IP    true       127.0.0.1
Port         int     HOST_PORT  false      80
```

## Supported Types

- [x] string
- [x] bool (`true` and `1` results in true value, anything else results in false value)
- [x] int

- [ ] float32
- [ ] float64
- [ ] complex64
- [ ] complex128
- [x] []slice (Slices of any other supported type. Environment variable should have coma separated values)
